# Garage Door Closer
Automatic closing of a garage door at 10 pm.

We designed our house to get directly from the stair house into the cellar and the garage. Unfortunately you can get through the garage into the house. Sometimes in the past we missed to close the garage door immediately or later and our hous is open to burglars (luckily no one used that way already). 

To prevent this I'd like to have the door closed automatically at 10 pm.

How to use this code:
1. clone the repository locally
2. Use the sloeber environment and import or create a new project with the code
3. download the project to the arduino

Additional requirements:
RTC Lib
